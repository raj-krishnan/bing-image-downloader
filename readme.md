Bing Wallpaper Downloader
=========================

This is a small python script which will download wallpapers from bing and set it as the desktop background in GNOME-Shell.

All downloaded images are stored in a subdirectory containing the script. Make sure that you are in the same directory as the python script or you may need to change the location of the logfile and images folder accordingly.

Presently, this works only with GNOME-Shell.

To do:

- Get user's confirmation before changing wallpaper
- Run this on booting up and/or every X hours as decided by the user
